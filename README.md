Ok, I use Pacman as the cover of my simple new github page because I am a fan of Arch Linux.

I am documenting a group of chatgpt toys here just for fun. All codes were written by ChatGPT. I have several projects in Python as well, but this page only demo's front end projects.

1. [Cube](https://psaux1.github.io/cube.html)
2. [Solar System](https://psaux1.github.io/solar.html)
3. [Snake Game](https://psaux1.github.io/snake.html)
4. [Matrix Rain](https://psaux1.github.io/matrix.html)
5. [Thomas Schelling's Segregation Model](https://psaux1.github.io/tom.html), see wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation).
